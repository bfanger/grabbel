| [buildUrl](src/buildUrl.ts) | Interpolate slugs into an url               |

## Origin

These are utilities functions that where being copied between projects.

Grabbel was created to make updating a utility across projects possible and create a canonical version.

This also allows starter templates like [bfanger/svelte-project-template](http://github.com/bfanger/svelte-project-template) to generate less boilerplate.

The name "grabbel" is inspired by teh dutch word [Grabbelton](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grabbelton) a box or bag where you blindly pick a small present.
